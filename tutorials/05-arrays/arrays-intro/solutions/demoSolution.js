/**** INTRODUCTION TO ARRAYS: SOLUTION ****/

/*
    An Array is a data structure that can hold a list of values. 
    Instead of creating ten different variables for ten crew members, 
    you can store them all in one place.

    Array Literals: We create arrays using square brackets [].

    Naming Practices: Since an array represents a collection, 
    it is a best practice to name your variable with a plural 
    noun (e.g., ships, planets, coordinates). This makes it 
    obvious to anyone reading your code that the variable holds 
    multiple items.

    Mixed Data: In JavaScript, an array can technically hold 
    different types of data (strings, numbers, booleans) all at 
    once, though usually, we try to keep them consistent. In the
    future you will learn about JavaScript objects, which are 
    better-suited for storing mixed data types.

/** EXAMPLE 1 - DECLARING ARRAYS **/

// An empty array (ready for cargo)
let cargoHold = [];

// An array of strings
let crewMembers = ["Shepard", "Garrus", "Tali", "Liara"];

// An array of numbers (engine temperatures)
let coreTemps = [98.6, 102.4, 115.0];

/** EXAMPLE 2 - GOOD NAMING PRACTICES **/

// Bad: Not clear it's a list
let ship = ["Discovery", "Endeavour", "Atlantis"];

// Good: Plural name tells us exactly what to expect
let shuttleNames = ["Discovery", "Endeavour", "Atlantis"];

/** EXAMPLE 3 - MIXED DATA TYPES **/

// This is valid in JS, but not always useful without labels.
// We will learn about objects soon, where we can associate related
// information in a better way!
let planetData = ["Jupiter", 95, 143000, "-110°C", ["hydrogen", "helium"]];
// name, number of moons, diameter in km, average temperature, composition
